# Terraform Project for Provisioning EKS Cluster

## Overview

This Terraform project automates the provisioning of an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster in the specified AWS region. It deploys essential infrastructure components, such as VPC, subnets, security groups, EKS nodes, and Kubernetes configurations like Metrics Server, ALB Ingress Controller, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (vX.X.X)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (vX.X.X)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (vX.X.X) - Kubernetes command-line tool

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each with its own set of Terraform configurations:

- `root`: Main configuration for the EKS cluster and overall project setup.
- `vpc`: Configuration for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- `eks`: Configuration for the EKS cluster itself.
- `nodegroups`: Node group configurations for EKS nodes.
- `iam`: IAM roles and policies.
- `networking`: Networking resources such as security groups and route tables.
- `k8s-config`: Kubernetes configurations, including add-ons and controllers.
- `monitoring`: Monitoring and logging tool configurations.
- `scripts`: Configuration for running scripts on the cluster.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

3. Initialize the project:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Configure your AWS credentials:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

5. Deploy the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Configure `kubectl` to connect to the EKS cluster:

   ```bash
   aws eks --region <your-region> update-kubeconfig --name <eks-cluster-name>
   ```

7. Verify the cluster setup:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

## Customization

You can customize the project by editing the various Terraform configuration files in the respective directories. Refer to the comments and documentation within each configuration file for details on what can be customized.

## Maintenance and Updates

Regularly check for updates to Terraform, AWS CLI, and Kubernetes tools, and apply any security patches or updates to your infrastructure.
